ChangeLog
---------

## v0.9.0 (in the development):

Added features:

 - [Online API reference](https://erthink.github.io/libmdbx/) by Doxygen.
 - Functions to explicit reader threads (de)registration.
 - Separated enums for environment, sub-databases, transactions, copying and data-update flags.
 - Support for read transactions preparation (`MDBX_TXN_RDONLY_PREPARE` flag).

TODO:

 - Native bindings for C++.
 - Packages for AltLinux, Fedora/RHEL, Debian/Ubuntu.

Deprecated functions and flags:

  - Usage of custom comparators and the `mdbx_dbi_open_ex()` are deprecated, since such databases couldn't be checked by the `mdbx_chk` utility.
    Please use the value-to-key functions to provide keys that are compatible with the built-in libmdbx comparators.
  - For clarity and API simplification the `MDBX_MAPASYNC` flag is deprecated.
    Just use `MDBX_SAFE_NOSYNC` or `MDBX_UTTERLY_NOSYNC` instead of it.


## v0.8.2 2020-07-06:
- Added support multi-opening the same DB in a process with SysV locking (BSD).
- Fixed warnings & minors for LCC compiler (E2K).
- Enabled to simultaneously open the same database from processes with and without the `MDBX_WRITEMAP` option.
- Added key-to-value, `mdbx_get_keycmp()` and `mdbx_get_datacmp()` functions (helpful to avoid using custom comparators).
- Added `ENABLE_UBSAN` CMake option to enabling the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer from GCC/CLANG.
- Workaround for [CLANG bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43275).
- Returning `MDBX_CORRUPTED` in case all meta-pages are weak and no other error.
- Refined mode bits while auto-creating LCK-file.
- Avoids unnecessary database file re-mapping in case geometry changed by another process(es).
  From the user's point of view, the `MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE` error will now be returned less frequently and only when using the DB in the current process really requires it to be reopened.
- Remapping on-the-fly and of the database file was implemented.
  Now remapping with a change of address is performed automatically if there are no dependent readers in the current process.


## v0.8.1 2020-06-12:
- Minor change versioning. The last number in the version now means the number of commits since last release/tag.

- Refine LTO (link time optimization) for clang.
- Force enabling exceptions handling for MSVC (`/EHsc` option).
