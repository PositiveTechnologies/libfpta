## Briefly, it is a portable 64-bit hash function:
  1. Intended for 64-bit little-endian platforms, predominantly for Elbrus and x86_64,
     but portable and without penalties it can run on any 64-bit CPU.
  2. In most cases up to 15% faster than StadtX hash, xxHash, mum-hash, metro-hash, etc.
     and all others portable hash-functions (which do not use specific hardware tricks).
  3. Provides a set of _terraced_ hash functions.
  4. Currently not suitable for cryptography.
  5. Licensed under [zlib License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_License).

Also pay attention to [Erlang](https://github.com/lemenkov/erlang-t1ha)
and [Golang](https://github.com/dgryski/go-t1ha) implementations.

# Usage
The `t1ha` library provides several terraced hash functions
with the dissimilar properties and for a different cases.
These functions briefly described below, see [t1ha.h](t1ha.h) for more API details.

To use in your own project you may link with the t1ha-library,
or just add to your project corresponding source files from `/src` directory.

Please, feel free to fill an issue or make pull request.


`t1ha0` = 64 bits, "Just Only Faster"
-------------------------------------

  Provides fast-as-possible hashing for current CPU, including 32-bit
  systems and engaging the available hardware acceleration.
  You can rest assured that t1ha0 faster than all other fast hashes
  (with comparable quality) so, otherwise we will extend and refine it time-to-time.

  On the other hand, without warranty that the hash result will be same
  for particular key on another machine or another version.
  Moreover, is deliberately known that the result will be different
  for systems with different bitness or endianness.
  Briefly, such hash-results and their derivatives, should be
  used only in runtime, but should not be persist or transferred
  over a network.

  Also should be noted, the quality of t1ha0() hashing is a subject
  for tradeoffs with performance. Therefore the quality and strength
  of `t1ha0()` may be lower than `t1ha1()` and `t1ha2()`,
  especially on 32-bit targets, but then much faster.
  However, guaranteed that it passes all SMHasher tests.

  Internally `t1ha0()` selects most faster implementation for current CPU,
  for now these are includes:

 | Implementation          | Platform/CPU                           |
 | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
 | `t1ha0_ia32aes_avx()`   | x86 with AES-NI and AVX extensions     |
 | `t1ha0_ia32aes_avx2()`  | x86 with AES-NI and AVX2 extensions    |
 | `t1ha0_ia32aes_noavx()` | x86 with AES-NI without AVX extensions |
 | `t1ha0_32le()`          | 32-bit little-endian                   |
 | `t1h0a_32be()`          | 32-bit big-endian                      |
 | `t1ha1_le()`            | 64-bit little-endian                   |
 | `t1ha1_be()`            | 64-bit big-endian                      |
 | `t1ha2_atonce()`        | 64-bit little-endian                   |


`t1ha1` = 64 bits, baseline fast portable hash
-------------------------------------

  The first version of "Fast Positive Hash" with reasonable quality
  for checksum, hash tables and thin fingerprinting. It is stable, e.g.
  returns same result on all architectures and CPUs.

  1. Speed with the reasonable quality of hashing.
  2. Efficiency on modern 64-bit CPUs, but not in a hardware.
  3. Strong as possible, until no penalties on performance.

  Unfortunatelly, [Yves Orton](https://github.com/demerphq/smhasher) discovered
  that `t1ha1()` family fails the strict avalanche criteria in some cases.
  This flaw is insignificant for the `t1ha1()` purposes and imperceptible
  from a practical point of view.
  However, nowadays this issue has resolved in the next `t1ha2()` function,
  that was initially planned to providing a bit more quality.

  The basic version of `t1ha1()` intends for little-endian systems and will run
  slowly on big-endian. Therefore a dedicated big-endian version is also
  provided, but returns the different result than the basic version.


`t1ha2` = 64 and 128 bits, slightly more attention for quality and strength
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  The recommended version of "Fast Positive Hash" with good quality
  for checksum, hash tables and fingerprinting. It is stable, e.g.
  returns same result on all architectures and CPUs.

  1. Portable and extremely efficiency on modern 64-bit CPUs.
  2. Great quality of hashing and still faster than other non-t1ha hashes.
  3. Provides streaming mode and 128-bit result.

  The `t1ha2()` is intended for little-endian systems and will run
  slightly slowly on big-endian systems.


`t1ha3` = 128 and 256 bits, fast non-cryptographic fingerprinting
---------------------------------------------------------
  The next-step version of "Fast Positive Hash",
  but not yet finished and therefore not available.


#### Planned: `t1ha4` = 128 and 256 bits, fast insecure fingerprinting

#### Planned: `t1ha5` = 256 bits, fast Cryptographic, but with some limitations

#### Planned: `t1ha6` = 256 and 512 bits, Cryptographic with reasonable resistance to acceleration on GPU and FPGA.

#### Planned: `t1ha7` = 256, 512 and 1024 bits, Cryptographic, Strong Post-Quantum

### Requirements and Portability:
  1. _t1ha_ designed for **modern 64-bit architectures**.
     But on the other hand, _t1ha_ doesn't require
     instructions specific to a particular architecture:
       - therefore t1ha could be used on any CPU for
         which compiler provides support 64-bit arithmetic.
       - but unfortunately _t1ha_ could be dramatically slowly
         on architectures without native 64-bit operations.
  2. This implementation of _t1ha_ requires **modern GNU C compatible compiler**,
     including Clang/LLVM, or **Visual Studio 2013/2015/2017**.
     For proper performance please use one of: GNU C 5.5 or later, CLANG 5.0 or later, Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 15.6 or later.

for _The 1Hippeus project - zerocopy messaging in the spirit of Sparta!_

 - running on CPU#3
 - use RDPMC_perf as clock source for benchmarking
 - assume it cheap and stable
 - measure granularity and overhead: 53 cycle, 0.0188679 iteration/cycle

```

The `test` tool support a set of command line options to selecting functions and size of keys for benchmarking.
For more info please run `./test --help`.

### The `--hash-stdin-strings` option
One noteable option is `--hash-stdin-strings`, it intended to estimate hash collisions on your custom data.
With this option `test` tool will hash each line from standard input and print its hash to standard output.

For instance, you could count collisions for lines from some `words.list` file by bash's command:
```
  ./t1ha/test --hash-stdin-strings < words.list | sort | uniq -c -d | wc -l
```

More complex example - count `xxhash()` collisions for lines from `words.list` and 0...10000 numbers,
with distinction only in 32 bit of hash values:
```
  (cat words.list && seq 0 10000) | \
     ./t1ha/test --xxhash --hash-stdin-strings | \
     cut --bytes=-8 | sort | uniq -c -d | wc -l
```


### SMHasher
[_SMHasher_](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki) is a wellknown
test suite designed to test the distribution, collision,
and performance properties of non-cryptographic hash functions.

_Reini Urban_ provides [extended version/fork of SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher)
which integrates a lot of modern hash functions, including _t1ha_.

So, **the quality and speed of _t1ha_ can be easily checked with the following scenario:**

```
git clone https://github.com/rurban/smhasher
cd smhasher
cmake .
make
./SMHasher City64
./SMHasher metrohash64_1
./SMHasher xxHash64
...
./SMHasher t1ha
```

For properly performance please use at least GCC 5.5, Clang 6.0 or Visual Studio 2017.

### Scores

Please take in account that the results is significantly depend on actual CPU, compiler version and CFLAGS.
The results below were obtained in **2016** with:
 - CPU: `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU`;
 - Compiler: `gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4)`;
 - CFLAGS: `-march=native -O3 -fPIC`;
